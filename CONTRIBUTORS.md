# Contribution Schedule and Timelines
Mentat is an ongoing effort that is primarily a product of Florida State University Panama City (FL) campus.
While contributions are accepted year-round, the list of contributors is grouped, roughly, by academic term and year, 
using the standard trimester scheme of Fall-Spring-Summer. Contributors, both students and otherwise, are included and 
grouped according to the time period in which they began their work on the project. Contributor groups are specified 
in reverse-chronological order. Within each group, contributors are ordered alphabetically by surname.
